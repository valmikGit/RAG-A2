    "answer": "The text provided does not explicitly state what finally convinces Brutus to join the conspirators. However, based on the conversation between Cassius and Brutus in Act 2, Scene 1, it can be inferred that Cassius' persuasion and manipulation of Brutus' feelings towards Caesar and his own sense of honor and duty as a Roman play a significant role in convincing Brutus to join the conspiracy.\n\nCassius appeals to Brutus' sense of justice and his dislike of flatterers, suggesting that Caesar is a tyrant who is being flattered and manipulated by others. Cassius also uses Brutus' own words and feelings against him, pointing out that Brutus hates flatterers, but is himself being flattered by Caesar.\n\nAdditionally, Cassius uses the fact that Caius Ligarius, a man who loves Brutus, has been wronged by Caesar, to further persuade Brutus to join the conspiracy. Cassius suggests that by joining the conspiracy, Brutus will be able to avenge Ligarius and restore honor to Rome.\n\nIt is likely that a combination of these factors, along with Cassius' persistent persuasion and manipulation, ultimately convinces Brutus to join the conspirators.

    "answer": "The provided text does not explicitly mention the news Brutus and Cassius receive from Rome. However, based on the context of Act 4, Scene 3, it appears that they receive some unfavorable news or reports, as Cassius mentions that Brutus has wronged him by condemning Lucius Pella for taking bribes, despite Cassius' letters in his favor. This suggests that Brutus and Cassius may have received news of discontent or disapproval from Rome, but the exact details are not specified in the given text.",

    "answer": "Cassius's response to the situation is one of anger and hurt. He feels that Brutus has wronged him by denying him the gold he requested to pay his legions, and by condemning Lucius Pella for taking bribes, despite Cassius's letters pleading on his behalf. Cassius takes Brutus's actions as a personal affront, and suggests that Brutus has become covetous and unfair. He even goes so far as to say that if Brutus is willing to treat his friends in such a way, the gods should punish him. However, when Brutus calms the situation and asks Cassius to explain his grievances, Cassius seems willing to move forward and discuss the issues at hand.",
