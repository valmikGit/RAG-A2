Question 1: What are the main themes in Julius Caesar?
Answer:
I don't have enough information to answer this question. The context provided focuses on specific scenes and dialogues from the play, but it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the main themes in Julius Caesar. However, some potential themes that can be inferred from the context include conspiracy, loyalty, power, and the consequences of one's actions, but a more detailed analysis of the play as a whole would be necessary to identify the main themes.

 I wish your enterprise today may thrive. What enterprise, Popilius? Fare you well. What said Popilius Lena? He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discoverèd. Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.—
 Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
 Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
 For I will slay myself. Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,
 For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,
 He draws Mark Antony out of the way. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go
 And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. He is addressed.

Question 2: How does Brutus justify killing Caesar?
Answer:
According to the context, Brutus justifies killing Caesar by stating that he slew his "best lover" (Caesar) "for the good of Rome" and that he has "the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death" (Page 63, Act 3, Scene 2). This implies that Brutus believes the assassination was necessary for the well-being of Rome and that he is willing to sacrifice himself if needed. However, the context does not provide a detailed explanation of Brutus' motivations or the specific reasons why he considered Caesar a threat to Rome.

 more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The
 question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his
 glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor
 his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others  with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,
 who, though he had no hand in his death, shall
 receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the
 commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With
 this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the
 good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself
 when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live!

Question 3: What role does Cassius play in the conspiracy?
Answer:
Cassius appears to be a key figure in the conspiracy against Caesar. He is mentioned as the one who "first did whet" the speaker (likely Brutus) "against Caesar" (Page 31), indicating that Cassius played a role in persuading or influencing Brutus to join the conspiracy. Additionally, Cassius is shown to be involved in the planning and execution of the conspiracy, as he is present when Popilius Lena wishes them success in their "enterprise" (Page 51) and is concerned that their purpose may be discovered. However, the exact nature and extent of Cassius' role in the conspiracy are not fully detailed in the provided context.

Go to the gate; somebody knocks. Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
 I have not slept. Between the acting of a dreadful thing
 And the first motion, all the interim is
 Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.
