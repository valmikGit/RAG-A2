 I wish your enterprise today may thrive. What enterprise, Popilius? Fare you well. What said Popilius Lena? He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discoverèd. Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.—
 Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
 Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
 For I will slay myself. Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,
 For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus,
 He draws Mark Antony out of the way. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go
 And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. He is addressed.

Question 2: How does Brutus justify killing Caesar?
Answer:
According to the context, Brutus justifies killing Caesar by stating that he did it "for the good of Rome" (Page 63, ACT 3. SC. 2). He also mentions that he has "the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death", implying that he is willing to sacrifice himself for Rome if necessary. However, the full reasoning behind Brutus' actions is not fully explained in the provided context.

 more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The
 question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his
 glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor
 his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others  with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,
 who, though he had no hand in his death, shall
 receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the
 commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With
 this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the
 good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself
 when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live!

Question 3: What role does Cassius play in the conspiracy?
Answer:
Cassius appears to be a key figure in the conspiracy against Caesar. He is the one who "first did whet" the speaker (likely Brutus) "against Caesar" ([Page 31]), suggesting that Cassius played a role in convincing Brutus to join the conspiracy. Additionally, Cassius is shown to be interacting with other conspirators, such as Brutus and Metellus Cimber, and is concerned about the potential discovery of their plan ([Page 51]). However, the exact nature and extent of Cassius' role in the conspiracy are not fully elaborated upon in the provided context.

Go to the gate; somebody knocks. Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
 I have not slept. Between the acting of a dreadful thing
 And the first motion, all the interim is
 Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.
